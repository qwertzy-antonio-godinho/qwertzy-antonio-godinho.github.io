The following are a list of resources I find useful for anyone interested in Malware analysis, Reverse engineering or just Computer science in general:

# Books

Don't do like I did and start with the "The Art of Memory Forensics: Detecting Malware and Threats in Windows, Linux, and Mac Memory" if you're a beginner -- you're in for a crash! These books while distinct, some of the contents overlap which is a good thing as you'll read multiple times the same thing but written in a different maner. My suggestion is to start with the easiest, by the following order:

1. [Malware Analyst's Cookbook and DVD: Tools and Techniques for Fighting Malicious Code](https://www.amazon.com/Malware-Analysts-Cookbook-DVD-Techniques/dp/0470613033)
2. [Practical Malware Analysis: The Hands-On Guide to Dissecting Malicious Software](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Malware-Analysis-Hands-Dissecting/dp/1593272901)
3. [The Ghidra Book: The Definitive Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Ghidra-Book-Definitive-Guide/dp/1718501021)
4. [The Art of Memory Forensics: Detecting Malware and Threats in Windows, Linux, and Mac Memory](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Memory-Forensics-Detecting-Malware/dp/1118825098)

# Twitter

Most, if not all Malware analysts use Twitter to discuss events, tools, samples and sometimes, talk about new job openings. You should definitely open an account if you haven't one.
By searching Twitter with #opendir hashtag you can find fresh samples posted by researchers that you can use for your write-ups. My handle is qwertzy-qwertzy-qwertzy @qwertxy

# Reddit

There are two Reddit communities (possibly more) you can join that deal with Malware and you can post questions or start discussions:

- [Reverse Engineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReverseEngineering/)
- [Malware Analysis & Reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/)

# IRC

The same goes for IRC:

irc.freenode.net

# Cheat-Cheats

# CTFs

# Reports

# OSINT

# Virtual Machines
